    Calculate a user's current reading streak in consecutive days.

    A streak is the number of consecutive calendar days on which the user
    finished at least one book, counting back from today (or yesterday, if

    Returns 0 if the user has no reading history or if there is a gap of
    more than one day since their most recent finished book.
